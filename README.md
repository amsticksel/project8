## Project Description/Outline
We are looking at Petfinder data on pets that are available for adoption. We are going to look at what breeds of dogs are up on the site the longest, what pet names are popular (by breed or sex), how dogs are tagged or described, and where certain breeds of dogs go up for adoption by state.

## Research Questions to Answer
1. What breeds of dogs have been on the site the longest?
2. Does the age of dogs have anything to do with adoptability?
3. What other factors influence how a dog gets adopted?
4. What dog names are most popular by breed?

## Datasets to Be Used
* Petfinder API: https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs
* (If we can find it, maybe someone has pulled earlier petfinder data and we can compare dogs still there vs adopted dogs?)

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
* Read through the documentation available on the Petfinder site
* Convert api information to dataframe/csv so we can stop calling the info
* Looking through the data & deciding how to splice the information
* Further brainstorming on what data we want to use, how to combine it
* Deciding how to best combine the data
* Breaking up the tasks into rough categories
* Make some visualization based on our individual tasks
